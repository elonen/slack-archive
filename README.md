# Export your Slack workspace as static HTML

Alright, so you want to export all your messages on Slack. You want them in a format that you
can still enjoy in 20 years. This tool will help you do that.

 * **Completely static**: The generated files are pure HTML and will still work in 50 years.
 * **Everything you care about**: This tool downloads messages, files, and avatars.
 * **Nothing you do not care about**: Choose exactly which channels and DMs to download.
 * **All types of conversations**: We'll fetch public channels, private channels, DMs, and multi-person DMs.
 * **Incremental backups**: If you already have local data, we'll extend it - no need to download existing stuff again.
 * **JSON included**: All data is also stored as JSON, so you can consume it with other tools later.
 * **No cloud, free**: Do all of this for free, without giving anyone your information.

## Using it

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, ideally something newer than Node v14.
2. Download and run a _temporary_ installation of the package, through the mighty `npx`[^1] runner:

   ```sh
   npx slack-archive
   ```
3. Feed your [User OAuth Token](#getting-a-token) to the prompt and let the program interactively guide you through all the options.
4. The exported data will be stored, in nice HTML format, inside the `./slack-archive` subdirectory. If the subdirectory already exist the program will compare the available workspace data with its content and download and merge only the newer additions.

[^1]: NPX is an acronym for Node Package Execute. It comes with NPM, the Node Package Manager. 
NPX has the ability to execute a Node package which wasn't previously installed, downloading it on the flight from the NPM registry.

## Getting a token

In order to download messages from private channels and direct messages, we will need a "User OAuth Token" associated with you and the target workspace. Slack uses this token to identify what permissions it'll give this app. We used to be able to just copy a token out of your Slack app, but now we'll need to create a custom app, install it to the target workspace and retrieve the token from its Slack API tab.

This will be mostly painless, I promise.

### 1) Configure your custom app

- Head over to https://api.slack.com/apps and sign in to your account.
- Press the `Create New App` button and select the `From an app manifest` option.
- Choose the workspace you'd like to backup with slack-archive.
- When prompted for an App Manifest, just paste in the following yaml configuration:

```yaml
_metadata:
  major_version: 1
  minor_version: 1
display_information:
  name: "Slack-Archive_<username>"
  description: "Export user-visible channel data as static HTML. Incrementally."
  background_color: "#de0446"
features:
  bot_user:
    display_name: Slack-Archive
    always_online: false
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    user:
      - channels:read
      - channels:history
      - files:read
      - groups:read
      - groups:history
      - mpim:read
      - mpim:history
      - im:read
      - im:history
      - users:read
    bot:
      - commands
      - chat:write
      - chat:write.public
settings:
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: false
  token_rotation_enabled: false
```

- Replace `<username>` with whatever identifier you prefer (e.g. `your-surname`); please notice that this app-name will be visible to all the workspace members, in the `Apps` tab of the Slack UI.
- Proceed and confirm the summary: your custom app is ready!
 

### 2) Authorize

- Select `Install to Workspace` at the top of the app page (or `Reinstall to Workspace` if you have done this previously).
- You will be prompted to an authorization page, review the permissions (they should match what you have configured in the yaml manifest).
- Then, from the `Features` menu on the left of the app page, select `OAuth & Permissions`: there you will find your **User OAuth Token**, which will generally be in `xoxp-********...` format. This is the token you need to past into the slack-archive prompt, in order for the program to work.
